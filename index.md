<p>British Columbia Scientists for Evidence-Based Policies is a group of graduate students based at the University of British Columbia. We donate our time to help organizations working to advance progressive, evidence-based policies by creating brief reviews of contemporary scientific literature, analyzing and visualizing data, and providing assistance and advice on data collection. Our members are interested in helping promote positive social change on a wide range of causes, including (but not limited to) environmental protection, indigenous rights, access to housing, and mental health. </p>
<p>If you are an organization that could benefit from our help, please visit our contact us page! </p>
