    <p>Katharina (Kate) Block is a Social Psychology researcher and PhD candidate at UBC. She is broadly interested in how stereotypes about the social groups we are members of influence how we think about ourselves (our self-concept) and what we do with our lives. She is especially interested in how gender stereotypes and biases shape the kinds of values men and women hold and the kinds of careers that they pursue. She is also interested in how children learn stereotypes and how that negatively affects them. Find out more about Kate at https://katharinablock.wordpress.com/ </p>
